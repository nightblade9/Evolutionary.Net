# Evolutionary.Net

Evolutionary.Net is an artificial intelligence code framework that allows you to easily write *genetic programs* using straightforward C# code. You can read more about it in [Greg Sommerville's repository](https://github.com/GregSommerville/Evolutionary.Net) which we forked from.

This is a fork of Evolutionary.NET to .NET Core.
